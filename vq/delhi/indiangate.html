				<h2>India Gate, New Delhi Overview</h2>
					<p>The All India War Memorial, popularly known as the India Gate, is located along the Rajpath in New Delhi. The imposing structure of India Gate is an awe-inspiring sight and is often compared to the Arch de Triomphe in France, the Gateway of India in Mumbai and the Arch of Constantine in Rome. This 42-meter tall historical structure was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and is one of the largest war memorials in the country. India Gate is also famous for hosting the Republic Day Parade every year.

Dedicated to 82,000 Indian and British soldiers who died during the First World War and the Third Anglo-Afghan War, this monument has the names of 13,300 servicemen inscribed on its surface. The foundation stone of this structure was laid down in the year 1921, and the final building was unveiled in the year 1931 by the Indian Viceroy Lord Irwin. The premises of India Gate also houses the Amar Jawan Jyoti, which is a kindled structure right underneath the archway. Built in 1971 post the Bangladesh Liberation War, the Amar Jawan Jyoti symbolises the eternal, immortal soldiers of India. Owing to its rich historical background and astonishing architecture, India Gate has become one of the most popular picnic spots in the city.</p>

				<h2>History of India Gate</h2>
					<p>The construction of the India Gate started in the year 1921, and it was a part of the British initiative to build graves and memorials for all the Indian and British soldiers who represented the British Empire in the First World War. The Duke of Connaught laid the foundation stone of the war memorial on 10th February 1921, and the memorial was finally inaugurated by Lord Irwin, India's Viceroy on 12th February 1931. It was dedicated to all the soldiers who laid their lives during the war so that the future generations would remember them for the noble sacrifice they made for the love of their country.
Below the India Gate, lies a small shrine-like structure made up of black marble, which always has a fire burning in it. This is known as the Amar Jawan Jyoti, or the Flame of the Immortal Soldier. The words "Aman Jawan Jyoti" are inscribed on all four sides of the structure. It was built after the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War and has since then been known as India's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.</p>
				<h2>Design of India Gate</h2>
					<p>Sir Edwin Lutyens, one of the finest war memorial designers, drafted the design for the All India War memorial in New Delhi. Perched on the centre of a hexagonal complex with a diameter of 625 metres, India Gate covers a total area of 3,60,000 metres square. It is 42 metres tall and has a width of 9.1 metres. It stands on a low base red stone from Bharatpur and then rises in stages. There is a shallow dome shaped bowl on the top of the India Gate which is rarely filled with burning oil on special occasions. The India Gate is a secular memorial, leaving aside religious and cultural sentiments. Lutyen used the universal architectural style free of religious ornamentation. It has also been called as the remake of Arch de Triomphe since it resembles the structure. Also, right behind the spectacular India Gate, around 150 metres away, is a canopy like structure which was also built by Edwin Lutyens. It had a statue of Lord George V. but later it was removed.

On both the sides of the arch of India Gate, 'India' is inscribed in upper case with dates MCMXIV (1914) and MCMXIX (1919) on its either sides. Below the word 'India', in upper case letters, is inscribed: "To the dead of the Indian armies who fell and are honoured in France and Flanders Mesopotamia and Persia East Africa Gallipoli and elsewhere in the near and the far-east in sacred memory also of those whose names are here recorded and who fell in India or the north-west frontier and during the third Afghan War."</p>
