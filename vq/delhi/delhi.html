				<h2>"The city of cities"</h2>
				<h2>New Delhi Tourism </h2>
				<p> From historical monuments to crowded shopping malls, from Mughal gardens to Delhi University campus, the capital city has multiple personalities making it 'The good, the bad and the ugly'.

New Delhi is a vivid blend of traditions, cultural diversity, political importance as well as architectural brilliance. It bridges its historical glory with the current modern era. It is a popular tourist spot and also houses multiple theatres and centres of performing arts. Delhi's architectural brilliance can be traced as back as 4th century AD when the Iron Pillar was built in the Mehrauli area, which hasn't shown any sign of rusting yet. The Qutub Minar, India Gate, Rashtrapati Bhawan, Delhi has numerous monuments showcasing both architectural and historical magnificence. ISKCON Temple, Akshardham Temple and the Lotus temple are some other beautiful buildings here. However, Delhi's magic lies in the Chandni Chowk area near the Jama Masjid with the old bazaars bustling and chirping with thousands of visitors haggling with vendors to buy things at the cheapest rate possible. Delhi's food is equally important to describe why people keep coming back to this wonderful city. From 5 star hotels and restaurants to the Parathe Wali Gali, Delhi has an amazing food culture and if you are not used to Indian street food, you might also get to suffer from Delhi Belly, but it might be just worth it.</p>
