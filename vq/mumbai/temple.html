				<h2>Siddhivinayak Temple, Mumbai Overview</h2>
					<p>The Siddhivinayak Temple is a revered shrine dedicated to Lord Ganesha and is one of the most significant and frequented temples in Prabhadevi of Mumbai, Maharashtra. This temple was built in the year 1801 by Laxman Vithu and Deubai Patil. The couple did not have any children of their own and decided to build the Siddhivinayak temple so as to fulfil the wishes of other infertile women. It is one of the richest temples in Mumbai and devotees visit this temple in large numbers on a daily basis. The statue of Lord Ganesha here is believed to be self-manifested.

The Siddhivinayak temple has a small sanctum housing the idol of Shri Ganesha, which is about two and a half feet wide and made out of a single piece of black stone. The trunk of the Lord tilts to the right, and a snake adorns the idol much like a thread would. The deity has four arms and is hence known as 'Chaturbhuj'. He carries a lotus in his upper right hand, a small axe in his upper left hand, a rosary in his lower left hand and a bowl full of his favourite snack 'modaks' as well. Flanked by Goddesses Riddhi and Siddhi who signify wealth and prosperity, the image of the Lord here is one that is of utmost importance to the people of faith. A temple of Lord Hanuman is also present in the premises.</p>

				<h2>Siddhivinayak Temple History</h2>
					<p>The story behind the construction of the Siddhivinayak temple is that of faith and belief in the Lord. The building was funded by rich Agri woman named Deubai Patil, who did not have any children of her own. She decided upon building a temple dedicated to Lord Ganesha so that he may fulfil the wishes of other childless couples and bless them with children. The construction of the Siddhivinayak temple was completed on 19 November 1801, with the original structure being a square edifice adorned with a dome - shaped spire. Ramakrishna Jambhekar Maharaj who a disciple of the Hindu saint Akkalkot Swami Samarth, buried two idols in front of the present idol upon the instructions of the Swami. As was prophesied by Swami Samarth, a Mandar tree sprouted from the buried idols with the image of Svayambhu Ganesha in its branches after a period of 21 years.</p>
				<h2>Siddhivinayak Temple Architecture</h2>
					<p>The imposing structure of Shree Siddhivinayak temple comprises of a primary 'Kalash' which towers to a height of 12 feet, three reaching up to 5 feet and 33 others which stand at a height of 3.5 feet. Thus, 37 gilded domes embellish the main temple complex. The old part of the Siddhivinayak temple has a hall, the main sanctum, a verandah and a water tank as well. The new complex of the temple was built as a part of renovations so as to enhance the magnificence of this shrine. The architect Ar. Shri. Sharad Athale of SK Athale & Associates made a study of the temples in Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu before finalising the design of the temple. After making the necessary arrangements, the construction of the Siddhivinayak temple commenced in the year 1990. The old idol was kept intact whilst a multi angular six - storey structure was built over the gold plated domes. Three main entrances leading up to the interior were constructed and the crown of the temple was redesigned as well. After meticulous work that was spread over a timeframe of three years, the construction gave way to the Siddhivinayak temple as we know it today.</p>
