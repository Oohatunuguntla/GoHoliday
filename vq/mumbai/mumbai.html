				<h2>"The City of Dreams"</h2>
				<h2>Mumbai Tourism </h2>
				<p> 'The City that Never Sleeps', 'The City of Dreams' and 'The City of Seven Islands' are just a few of the epithets used to describe the wonderful city of Mumbai. Home to India's film industry, this capital of Maharashtra and financial capital of India is multi-dimensional and provides a lot of exciting experiences. And it demands to be experienced!

The most striking thing about Mumbai is its diversity. The rich and the poor, movie stars and day labourers, tall skyscrapers and largest slum area, grand malls and local bazaars all exist side-by-side in this city. Mumbai is adorned with great beaches, lakes, and the lush green Sanjay Gandhi National Park. The south of Mumbai is the old city and is a great option for heritage walks. Marine Drive, popularly known as the "Queen's Necklace" is like a jewel adorning the city sea face. There are also popular religious sites in Mumbai like the Siddhi Vinayak Mandir, Mount Mary Church and the Haji Ali Dargah. Mumbai is also known as the India's New York for its impressive skyline.</p>
