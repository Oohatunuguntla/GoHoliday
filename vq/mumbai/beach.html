				<h2>Juhu Beach, Mumbai Overview</h2>
					<p>Juhu beach is the longest beach in Mumbai, and arguably the most popular among tourists as well. Juhu beach is renowned for its wide variety of street food with a very typical Mumbai flavour.  The nearby area of Juhu is a posh locality in Mumbai, home to a lot of famous Bollywood and TV celebrities - the most famous being Amitabh Bachhan's bungalow - and it is not very rare to spot a celebrity jogging on the beach. 

This is also one of the best spots in Mumbai to watch a sunset, with a cool evening breeze, and one of the few places where you see the "relaxed" side of the Maximum City. 

Television shoots are often held and a number of toy-sellers, roasted corn vendors and acrobats attract the eye. Stretched from Vile Parle to Santa Cruz, children often have fun plane spotting with a departure runway near the edge of the sea. 

You may also visit the iconic Iskcon Temple which is meters away from the beach or indulge in a theatre experience at the famous Prithvi Cafe. Jalsa, Amitabh Bachchan's home is also in the vicinity and attracts an enormous crowd on weekends. There are also a number of famous cafes, restaurants, and pubs around this area which never sleeps, you'll find people taking a stroll as late as 3 am at night.

Juhu beach was a big favorite with the Mumbai locals during the 90s, but it had become notorious for being very dirty because of a large number of tourists. However, in the last couple of year the BMC had made a lot of efforts to keep the beach clean. It is now cleaned almost daily, and lot of dustbins have been installed which help keep the area much cleaner than it used to be.</p>

				<h2>Early mornings at Juhu Beach</h2>
					<p>For those looking to avoid the mad rush of tourists and experience the relaxed nature of the beach, early mornings are a great time to visit. The beach is surprisingly empty, with only the nearby residents coming here for a morning run, walk their dogs, or play frisbee. You would see a number of runners running along the 3km+ coast, quite a few of them barefoot. Almost all the food stalls are closed at this hour, and there are only a few vendors selling tea or coconut water. The beach is cleaned late night/early morning, so this is also when the beach is at its cleanest!</p>
			
		
			
			
			
			<h2>Sunsets at Juhu Beach</h2>
				<p>Facing the west, Juhu beach naturally has a brilliant sunset, in all weathers. Granted, the beach is crowded at this time - specially if it's a weekend - but walk a few minutes away from where all the food stalls are, and you should be able to find an empty-ish spot for yourself. Grab a simple blanket (available on rent for rs. 50) and relax on the sand while enjoying the sunset. You can get a lot of snacks to eat while sitting - like chana jor garam, bhel, vada pao to name only a few.</p>
			<h2>Food at Juhu Beach</h2>
				<p>The variety of snacks that you can get on the beach is pretty incredible. There are a lot of shops near the main parking area which sell a number of local food items - panipuri, bhelpuri, misal pao, pao bhaji, vada pao. You can also get great South Indian food : masala dosa, idli, vada being the most common. Chinese is pretty popular and common too. Although the street food here is not the tastiest - and many would argue healthiest - there is a lot to choose from, and street food lovers would definitely be excited.</p>
			
			<h2>Late nights at Juhu Beach</h2>
				<p>Although the police start driving people away from the beach around 1AM, it is not too uncommon (or difficult) to sneak in from one of the side openings to the beach. The beach is surprisingly quiet at this hour, with hardly a few other adventurous souls venturing out so late. As long as you are not a nuisance, you can take a quiet stroll along the beach or sit and talk on the sand. </p>

			<h2>Best time to visit Juhu Beach</h2>
				<p>Juhu beach is a great place to visit all times of the year, especially during early morning or evenings. Even in the hot summer months, the evenings are very pleasant as a cool sea breeze blows, and the temperatures being mild.
