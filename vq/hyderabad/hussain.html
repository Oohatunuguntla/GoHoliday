				<h2>Hussain Sagar Lake, Hyderabad Overview</h2>
					<p>Renowned as Asia's largest artificial lake, the Hussain Sagar Lake is one of the most popular tourist hotspot situated in Hyderabad. The lake itself was built by Ibrahim Quli Qutub Shah in 1563 during the rule of Ibrahim Quli Qutub Shah. Renowned for its monolith of Lord Buddha which is right in the centre of the lake, this place is famously known as Tank Bund as well. Interestingly, the imposing statue of Buddha was a much later addition to the Hussain Sagar Lake. The attraction also has 3 km long dam wall and connects the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad.

Although the Hussain Sagar Lake is popular for activities such as fish culture, water sports and boat rides, the major attraction of the lake is a monolithic Buddha statue situated right at the heart of the lake. The statue of Buddha was installed in the year 1993 and was inaugurated by His Holiness Dalai Lama himself. Standing at the Tank Bund, you can see an outline of the lake done by lights appearing as a diamond studded necklace. Thus, the road is also known as the 'Necklace Road'. Owing to its unique heart - shaped outline, the Hussain Sagar Lake has been declared as the 'Heart of the World' by UNWTO.</p>

				<h2>History of Hussain Sagar Lake</h2>
					<p>Hussain Sagar Lake was built in 16th century by Ibrahim Quli Qutub Shah in appreciation of Hussain Shah Wali, who is believed to have been the force behind its unique heart - shaped design. Constructed on a tributary of Musi River in 1563, the water in the lake is perennially fed by canals from the Musi river. Hussain Sagar was the main source of water supply to Hyderabad before Himayat Sagar and Osman Sagar were built on river Musi. Today, it is flocked by tourists and visitors in large number and has become one of the most popular tourist attraction in the city 
</p>
				<h2>Architecture of Hussain Sagar Lake</h2>
					<p>Covering a massive area of 5.7 square kilometers, the Hussain Lake was artificially constructed over the Musi River by Quli Qutub Shah. A 3 km long dam wall connecting Hyderabad and Secunderbad is a part of the premises as well. A 16 m high monolithic Buddha statue weighing at 350 tonnes is erected right at the centre of the lake. Crafted entirely out of white granite, the magnificent statue is placed upon what is known as the "Rock of Gibralter". </p>
