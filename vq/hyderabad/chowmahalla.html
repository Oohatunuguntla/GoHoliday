				<h2>Chowmahalla Palace, Hyderabad Overview</h2>
					<p>Once the seat of the Asaf Jahi dynasty, the Chowmahalla Palace was built in Hyderabad between the years 1857 and 1869. This splendid monument served as the official residence of the Nizams of Hyderabad during their reign. The edifice of the Chowmahalla Palace was the main venue where the Nizams used to entertain their guests and other special visitors and organise many elaborate ceremonies. The palace is designed very intricately and is well known for its unique style and elegance which holds a unique Nawabi charm in itself. It is still the property of Barkat Ali Khan Mukarram Jah, heir of the Nizams and has been decorated with UNESCO's Asia Pacific Merit award in 2010 as well.

The architecture of the Chowmahalla Palace is an imposing sight to behold. The facade itself is a delicate artwork of domes, arches, windows and meticulously carved out designs. The complex is elegantly embellished with gentle fountains, expansive lush gardens, numerous palaces, Clock Tower, Roshan Bangla and the Council Hall. One of the most outstanding features of the magnificent palace is the Durbar Hall which is also known as the Grand Khilwat. The Courtyard here is a fairytale venue to hold the most exquisite dinner parties, with the palace standing firmly in the background. The Chowmahalla Palace has been restored to its present glory with careful considerations and is now open to the public as both a historical extravaganza and delightful party location.</p>

				<h2>History of Chowmallah Palace</h2>
					<p>The construction of the Chowmahalla palace was initiated by Salabat Jung in 1750 and it was completed during the period of Afzal ad Dawlah, Asaf Jah V. The fifth Nizam ensured the completion of the Chowmahalla palace within 1869. The Palace went on to become the main residence of the Nawabs and the royal court was held here as well. Even in the olden times, the palace was the main centre for all activities pertaining to the Nizam rule, including festive ceremonies and welcome parties hosted for esteemed guests. This was also a stopover for Grand Khilwat and served as a guesthouse for other royalty. It is believed to have taken inspiration from the Shah of Iran's palace in Tehran built by Juveria Khan Rahimullah.
					
				<h2>Architecture of Chowmallah Palace</h2>
					<p>The architectural style of the Chowmahalla palace has its influence from Persian, Rajasthani, Indo-Saracenic and European styles. Originally spread over an area of 45 acres, the palace now covers only 12 acres presently. Chowmahalla Palace consists of two courtyards, the northern courtyard and the southern courtyard. There are elegant palaces, the grand Khilwat (Durbar Hall), many fountains and beautiful gardens. There are four palaces inside, Aftab Mahal, Afzal Mahal, Tanhiyat Mahal and Mahtab Mahal. The northern courtyard has the Bara Imam, where all the major administrative activities took place.  </p>
					
					<h2>Events at Chowmahalla Palace</h2>
					<p>In keeping with the traditions of the Nawabs, the Chowmahalla Palace regularly hosts a number of events for the benefit of its guests. Heritage walks that take you through Old Hyderabad are a great way to rediscover the avenues of history and are organised here regularly. Annual Chowmahalla Music and Dance Festival is a colourful fanfare, where you can witness a number of amazing performances ranging from divine qawallis to enchanting dance performances.   </p>
