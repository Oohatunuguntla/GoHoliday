				<h2>Charminar, Hyderabad Overview</h2>
					<p>Charminar is the most prominent landmark located right in the heart of Hyderabad. The monument was erected when Quli Qutb Shah shifted his capital from Golconda to Hyderabad. It got its name from its structure as it consists of four minarets. The imposing structure looks awe-inspiring during the night when it is illuminated. The life around Charminar never ceases to throb, as this part smells and feels like the real Hyderabad. The area around Charminar is popular for colourful bangles, jewellery, pearls and scrumptious dishes. The essence of Charminar lies in four things - the laid back crowds, the packed markets, the lip smacking biryani and the Irani chai!
					
Since the construction of the monument in 1591, Charminar is synonymous with the culture of Hyderabad standing tall as a reminder of the glorious days of the past era. It is a massive structure which has four minarets which many believe stand for the first four khalifas of Islam. It is situated on the east bank of Musi River and stands tall amidst the labyrinthine Laad Bazaar in the old city. The Charminar is an example of unpatrolled artistic brilliance, and it is also considered to be one of the marvellous structures in India. Towards the north of Charminar, there are four gateways known as Char Kaman which is constructed in the cardinal directions. The structure was intended to serve as a Madrasa or a Mosque. It is mainly built of Indo-Islamic architecture along with the incorporation of Persian Architectural elements.</p>

				<h2>History of charminar</h2>
					<p>Charminar was built by Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah, the fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty when he shifted his capital from Golconda to Hyderabad. According to the historians, the inadequacy of water and the plague forced Quli Qutub Shahi to move his capital. He pledged to build a monument if the suffering of his people came to an end. The Charminar was built to commemorate the decision and eradication of plague from the city. It is known as Charminar as it is supported by four minarets on four sides which were possibly meant to commemorate the first four caliphs of Islam. The old city of Hyderabad was designed keeping Charminar as the centre of the city. 
					
					According to some legends, Quli Qutub Shahi saw his beloved wife, Baghmati, at this very site. He built Charminar as a symbol of his eternal love for his wife. There is also a legend that talks about the existence of a secret tunnel under the Charminar that connects it to the Golkonda Fort. It was created as a means of escape for the royal family in the time of emergencies. According to some legends, Quli Qutub Shahi saw his beloved wife, Baghmati, at this very site.

				<h2>Structure of Charminar</h2>
					<p>The structure of Charminar is a perfect square, inspired by the shape of the Shiya Tazias, each side 20 meters in length. It has four grand arches that face a fundamental point that open into four streets. There stands a 56 meters tall minaret at each corner with a double balcony. Each minaret has a dome on top with petal like designs at the base. You need to climb 149 steps to reach the upper floor. The structure is made of granite, mortar, marble and limestone. There is a mosque located at the western end of the open roof. You can get a bird's eye view of the city from the balconies of Charminar. The devout people could offer prayers in a very peaceful manner inside the mosque.

The structure of Charminar is an exquisite example of Indo-Islamic architecture with Persian influences. The arches and domes of the monument define the influence of Islamic architecture, while the Persian influence is prominent from its minarets. The balconies and the outside walls, embellished with delicate stucco floral ornamentations on the ceiling, showcases the influence of the Hindu style of architecture. The area surrounding the Charminar is also known by the same name, thriving with the most famous market in the city. </p>
