The magnificent temple comprises of five storeys and has a rock-cut structure. It has been one of the most important and earliest built temples in the entire Southern India. The top structure of the temple is decorated with sculptures and carvings. Also, to provide a much better protection to the striking temple from sea-erosion, a stone has been constructed as well.This pyramidal structure which has a height of 60 feet is present atop 50 feet square platform. It beautifully showcases the Dravidian style of architecture along with an elite history mixed with magnificence. It was designed to seize the first rays of rising sun and to catch hold of the waters after sunset due to which as per Percy Brown it served as a landmark by day and a beacon by night. Mandapas and compound walls surround the grand temple. A rock-cut of a lion having a small square-shaped cut in its belly which is ridden by two young women can be seen too on the temple walls.  </p>
